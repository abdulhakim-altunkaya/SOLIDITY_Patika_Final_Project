## GETTING STARTED

As the project has a frontend, you do not need to deploy any dependecy on your computer. Here are the easy steps to interact with PetixCoin:

<strong>1) </strong> Make sure you have Metamask on your browser. Preferably use Google Chrome.

<strong>2) </strong>If you do not have "Fantom Testnet" in your Metamask networks list, then follow these steps below. If you have, you can skip to step 3.

<strong>2.a) </strong>Open Metamask, find "Add Networks" button inside networks list and click on it.

<strong>2.b) </strong>Click on "Add Networks Manually" and then copy paste following settings below and then click on "save":

<strong>Network name:</strong> fantom testnet <br>
<strong>New RPC URL:</strong> https://rpc.testnet.fantom.network/ <br>

<strong>Currency symbol:</strong> FTM  <br>

<strong>3) </strong>You will need Fantom Test tokens. Go to following website ( https://faucet.fantom.network/ ) and get some Fantom test tokens.

<strong>4) </strong>Now go to project website: https://petixcoin-patika.netlify.app/
